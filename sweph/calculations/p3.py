# sweph/calculations/p3.py
# tertiary progression (aka minor progression)
# as per richard houck (astrology of death)
# divide year by sidereal month & use blocks of 13-14 days as representing
# a year in life
# use tertiary planets & tertiary solar arc'd mc (and derived asc) as they hit
# the natal chart
# a day in life (or ephemeris) is equal to a lunar month in the life
# p3 MC by amount of tertiary solar arc, ie roughly 1 degree per month
# p3 ASC just a slight variation on this : derived normally per Table of Houses
# tertiary angles for rectification : every week of event error (p3 angles) will
# correlate to about 1 minute of birthtime error ; tertiary angles will pass
# about 2 1/2 years in each sign and house : correlates to transiting Saturn
# and the p2 progressed Moon

# Dasa / Bhukti planets with p3 planets, 3 rules that apply (subject of death)
# 1. p3 planetary stations intensify amplitude to symbolic message in the chart
# quality of amplitude related directly to fundamental nature of planet
# 2. an approximate correlation between current Dasa ( or Bhukti planet ) and a
# p3 planetary station : often signal death if subsidiary factors confirm
# 3. expect apx p3 angle & planet hits in exact 4th harmonic to current maraka
# chart sensible to prenatal and p3 eclipses : any point in a chart ( planet or
# angle) becomes extremely sensitized if hit directly by one of these eclipses
# ancient astrologers considered eclipses evil : interrupted luminaries
# 1 degree exact ; jyotisa rules for aspects : ma 4/8 ju 5/9 sa 3/10

# calculate lunar returns before and after e2 (gives exact lunar month)
# mc progressed by solar arc with all other cusps calculated from that
# p3 su & mc move around chart at about 1 ° per month, with p3 asc typically
# at a very slight variation > p3 angles in signs about 2 & ½ years (about as
# long as Tsa spends in a sign, p3 su circles chart same as Tsa. p3 mo moves
# ½ a ° per day > 2 months in sign, 2 years to circle entire chart
